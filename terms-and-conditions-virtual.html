            <p>SUGSA’s mission is to welcome change within the Agile space. We aim to create opportunities for
                learning, sharing, and connecting, in support of a healthy, vibrant community of users of Agile and
                lightweight software development methods and processes. SUGSA is a non-profit group, run by a committee
                of volunteers.</p>

            <p>This document details the SUGSA committee’s expectations of speakers at the conference
                (speakers and workshop facilitators will be referred to as ‘speakers’ throughout this document).
                Please get in touch with us on <a href="emailto:info@sugsa.org.za">info@sugsa.org.za</a> should you have
                any
                concerns or questions
                relating to this document.</p>

            <h3>General code of conduct:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SUGSA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
                    everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                    body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). All speakers are expected to adhere to
                    SUGSA’s Code of Conduct:
                    <a href="https://sugsa.org.za/about-us/code-of-conduct/"
                        target="_blank">https://sugsa.org.za/about-us/code-of-conduct/</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Accommodation, Travel and Reimbursements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There will be no accommodation and travel arranged or reimbursed for the Virtual event.</li>
                    <li>A ticket to the event will be provided, free of charge, to all accepted speakers.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our speakers are an important part of our community. As such, we hope the speakers will attend
                        and
                        participate, as much as possible, during the 2 day conference.
                    </li>
                    <li>We request speakers to at least be online 30 minutes before their speaker slot and 30 minutes
                        after
                        for questions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>During Workshops or Talks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>By agreeing to speak at the Regional Scrum Gathering® South Africa 2022, speakers consent
                        to have a committee member introduce them to the audience and to ensure that the
                        session remains on schedule. This includes the use of visual cues (printed flashcards) to
                        indicate progress against the scheduled end time, and bringing the session to a close if
                        the speaker does not do so timeously. For either format, we recommend allocating the
                        last 15 minutes for questions and answers from the audience. We pride ourselves on
                        hosting a conference where all speakers respect each other and the audience, allowing
                        us to run on schedule.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Virtual edition of Regional Scrum Gathering®(SM) South Africa 2022 will be hosted using Zoom
                        or
                        a similar tool. SUGSA will provide hosted links and provide breakout room functionality as
                        needed.
                        It is not required that you have a paid Zoom account, but we do recommend using the application
                        over
                        the browser with the latest updates installed.

                    </li>
                    <li>It is expected that the talk or workshop that the speaker gives remains aligned to the content
                        and
                        structure as submitted in their proposal, and accepted onto the program. We request that as a
                        speaker, you pay careful attention to this as conference attendees make selections for talks
                        they
                        would like to attend based on the information submitted and published.</li>
                    <li>If a speaker would like us to share their slides with our community following the
                        conference, we require the slides within two working days from the last day of the
                        conference.
                    </li>
                    <li>SUGSA will collect feedback after the talk or workshop via the event app. The feedback
                        will be shared with the speaker following the conference.
                    </li>
                    <li>SUGSA may choose to record the images, film and sound of your talk to distribute during or after
                        the
                        event.</li>
                    <li>SUGSA acknowledges and appreciates the contributions made by the speaker(s) and their companies
                        that
                        contribute to the success of our community. Speakers will be allowed to mention their Company
                        and
                        Agile-related products, books, and services as part of their introduction, however, extended
                        sales-pitches disguised as sessions are not welcome.</li>

                <h3>Cancellation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>While we have taken every precaution to ensure that the Gathering will continue as planned, in
                        the
                        event that Regional Scrum Gathering®(SM) South Africa 2022 needs to be cancelled due to any
                        unforeseen circumstances, all speakers will be notified immediately.

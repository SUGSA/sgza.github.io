        <h3>SGZA21 Theme: Embracing Simplicity</h3>
        <p>In a world in which complexity seems to be rapidly increasing, how do we embrace simplicity and
            effectively
            maximize the amount of work not done in our approaches?
        </p>
        <p>This year we’re looking for perspectives and insights that embrace the avoidance of waste and reduce
            overt
            complexity to achieve ultimate sophistication.
        </p>
        <p>We’d like to explore opposing positions, discover unexpected views and leave with a slightly more open,
            inclusive view of the world.
        </p>
        <p>There is so much knowledge and wisdom in our community - we’re looking for speakers and attendees that
            will
            help us to create a conference which not only creates a safe space to learn but deep dives into what it
            means to embrace simplicity as an Agilist.</p>
        <p>We value:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New ideas <strong>over</strong> old content</li>
            <li>Specific opinion <strong>over</strong> one-size-fits-all</li>
            <li>Own experiences from the field <strong>over</strong> theory</li>
            <li>Interactive sessions <strong>over</strong> sit-and-listen (but there’s room for both)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want to be sure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your proposal supports our theme – Embracing Simplicity – and that it contributes depth (or breadth)
                to
                the community’s discussions
            </li>
            <li>You can comfortably deliver what you’re proposing, regardless of whether you are well known or a
                first-timer on the conference speaking scene
            </li>
            <li>People will be excited and intrigued to attend your session</li>
            <li>People will get something of value from the time spent in your session</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don’t need to achieve all the points above, but if you don’t hit at least a few of them, you need to
            give
            it more thought.
        </p>
        <strong>How to get rejected:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Include a same-old, same-old topic or approach (unless there’s a new twist or a truly deep
                experience
                base)
            </li>
            <li>Include thinly-veiled (or unveiled) marketing or promotion of services</li>
            <li>Your submission’s golden thread and “Why?” are difficult to follow or understand</li>
            <li>It does not appear that an adequate level of effort was involved in your submission</li>
            <li>Include specific personally-identifying information (name, company you work for) in the body of the
                submission – please do not do this – we follow a blind review and selection process (we hide names
                of
                people submitting in the system, so that the selection process is free from bias)
            </li>
            <li>Your submission does not address any of the topic tracks outlined below</li>
        </ul>
        <i>(Thanks to <a href="http://lets-test.com/" target="_blank"> Let’s Test SA </a> for inspiring us to
            clarify the
            CFP in this style)</i>
        <br/><br/>
        <p>In addition to the above guidelines, please take a look at two past examples of good submissions for a
            talk
            and workshop respectively.</p>

        <h3>Our Topic Tracks</h3>
        <p>The questions included below are to stimulate ideas and to help clarify the focus of the track. They aren’t
            meant to be restrictive.</p>

        <h4>Breaking Down Barriers:</h4>
        <p>This track will offer the attendees simple and practical ways in which we can break down the invisible wall
            between new ways of working and traditional ways of working. We want to share some of the realities that we
            face every day and present ways in which we have overcome challenges in our organizations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you had to make compromises or adjustments in your practice of agile to accommodate your
                environment?
            </li>
            <li>How have you embraced different areas in your organization (i.e. HR, Finance, PMO, Management), or
                across industries whilst staying true to Agile ways of work?
            </li>
            <li>What practical steps have you taken to bridge the gap in the understanding and application of agile?
                What failed and what worked?
            </li>
            <li>What challenges do you face in your organizations and what have you done to overcome them? What worked
                and what didn’t?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Back To Basics:</h4>
        <p>The Back to Basics track will offer attendees the opportunity to discover and explore ideas, techniques, and
            concepts that solve problems in their simplest form. This track aims to share the foundational knowledge
            needed for Agility to thrive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What lessons about the basics of agile can you share from your own experiences or challenges you have
                overcome?
            </li>
            <li>What simple steps did you take to turn theory into practice that could help those who are just starting
                their Agile journey?
            </li>
            <li>How do we bring simplicity back into the way we work, i.e. Technical Excellence, Customer Value, etc?
            </li>
            <li>What does embracing the Agile Principle of maximising the amount of work not done, mean to you?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Communication & Collaboration:</h4>
        <p>This track aims to offer attendees the simplest proven and practical ways to improve communication and
            achieve effective collaboration. We encourage you to share your experience coaching, mentoring or
            facilitating both in-person and distributed improvements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How did you embrace simplicity to improve communication & collaboration?</li>
            <li>What have you done to leverage and/or improve Emotional Intelligence in teams? What are some practical
                steps that you have taken that you can share?
            </li>
            <li>How have you improved communication and collaboration within, and between, individuals and teams across
                the organisation?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Leadership Excellence:</h4>
        <p>The Leadership Excellence track will offer attendees an insightful look into what excellence in leadership
            means, and how they can support, empower or create Leadership Excellence. We want to know more about the
            ways that Embracing Simplicity in leadership can promote excellence in Agile?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How have you led a product journey? What were the different challenges that you faced and how did you
                overcome them? What does excellence in Product Leadership look like?
            </li>
            <li>What metrics have you used along your journey? How have they helped, or hindered, your progress as a
                leader?
            </li>
            <li>What are the simplest solutions you’ve implemented as a leader that resolved seemingly complicated
                problems?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
        <h5>A workshop versus a talk</h5>
        <p>A good guideline for a workshop is that the time you will be speaking needs to be 40% or less of the total
            session time, with the remainder of the time to be used for participant activities (doing an exercise or
            activity or interacting with other attendees). Workshops are typically 90 mins in length with talks being
            45mins.</p>
        <p>We pride ourselves on hosting a conference where all speakers respect each other, and the audience, allowing
            us to run on schedule.</p>

        <h5>A lightning talk</h5>
        <p>A lightning talk is short and punchy - just 15 minutes - including a quick intro from the room’s facilitator
            and any Q&A.</p>
        <p>A lightning talk doesn’t need to offer a solution, it can be designed to start a conversation, spark ideas
            and get people thinking or it could be sharing something interesting you’ve experienced.</p>

        <h5>Equipment available</h5>
        <p>Each room is equipped with a projector, a flipchart with markers, sticky notes and pens.</p>
        <p>The rooms are generally laid out with tables and chairs in banquet style.</p>
        <p>If you require any specialised items or room settings, please list these in the ‘notes’ section of Sessionize
            and we will try to accommodate you. We cannot guarantee this, so we will remain in contact with you while
            managing logistics.</p>

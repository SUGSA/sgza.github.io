        <h3>Call for Papers - Connecting agile</h3>
        <p>The verb ‘agile’ speaks to agility, being able to move quickly and easily with grace. The noun “Agile” speaks
            to different frameworks that can be applied.</p>
        <p>2023, our first conference back in person, we want to primarily focus on connection and re-energising our community.</p>
       
        <p>How do we enable our organisations to choose a framework that is relevant and most suited to their
            environment.
        </p>
        <p>How can we focus on Connecting as humans once again? As well as connecting new and existing industries and
            sharing knowledge and re-energising organisations with a focus on agile leadership. </p>
        <p>Zooming in on bridging communication and interaction gaps in this new world of “hybrid”.</p>
        <p>We’d like to understand new innovations in the agile space and challenge the status quo, whilst still
            covering the basics and focusing on the underlying principles.
        </p>
        <p>This year we’re looking for perspectives and insights that focus on connection. We’d like to explore opposing
            positions, discover unexpected views and leave with a slightly more open, inclusive view of the world.
        </p>
        <p>There is so much knowledge and wisdom in our community - we’re looking for speakers and attendees that will
            help us to create a conference which not only creates a safe space to learn but deep dives into what it
            means to connect to agile.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>New ideas <strong>over</strong> old content</li>
            <li>Specific opinion <strong>over</strong> one-size-fits-all</li>
            <li>Own experiences from the field <strong>over</strong> theory</li>
            <li>Interactive sessions <strong>over</strong> sit-and-listen (but there’s room for both)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want to be sure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your proposal supports our theme – Connecting agile – and that it contributes depth (or breadth)
                to
                the community’s discussions
            </li>
            <li>You can comfortably deliver what you’re proposing, regardless of whether you are well known or a
                first-timer on the conference speaking scene
            </li>
            <li>People will be excited and intrigued to attend your session</li>
            <li>People will get something of value from the time spent in your session</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don’t need to achieve all the points above, but if you don’t hit at least a few of them, you need to
            give
            it more thought.
        </p>
        <strong>How to get rejected:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Include a same-old, same-old topic or approach (unless there’s a new twist or a truly deep
                experience
                base)
            </li>
            <li>Include thinly-veiled (or unveiled) marketing or promotion of services</li>
            <li>Your submission’s golden thread and “Why?” are difficult to follow or understand</li>
            <li>It does not appear that an adequate level of effort was involved in your submission</li>
            <li>Include specific personally-identifying information (name, company you work for) in the body of the
                submission – please do not do this – we follow a blind review and selection process (we hide names
                of
                people submitting in the system, so that the selection process is free from bias)
            </li>
            <li>Your submission does not address any of the topic tracks outlined below</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
        <h6><i>(guidance for submitting a session)</i></h6>
        <h5>A workshop versus a talk</h5>
        <p>A good guideline for a workshop is that the time you will be speaking needs to be 40% or less of the total
            session time, with the remainder of the time to be used for participant activities (doing an exercise or
            activity or interacting with other attendees). Workshops are typically 90 mins in length with talks being
            45mins.</p>
        <p>We pride ourselves on hosting a conference where all speakers respect each other, and the audience, allowing
            us to run on schedule.</p>

        <h5>A lightning talk</h5>
        <p>A lightning talk is short and punchy - just 15 minutes - including a quick intro from the room’s facilitator
            and any Q&A.</p>
        <p>A lightning talk doesn’t need to offer a solution, it can be designed to start a conversation, spark ideas
            and get people thinking or it could be sharing something interesting you’ve experienced.</p>

        <!-- <h5>Equipment available</h5>
        <p>Each room is equipped with a projector, a flipchart with markers, sticky notes and pens.</p>
        <p>The rooms are generally laid out with tables and chairs in banquet style.</p>
        <p>If you require any specialised items or room settings, please list these in the ‘notes’ section of Sessionize
            and we will try to accommodate you. We cannot guarantee this, so we will remain in contact with you while
            managing logistics.</p> -->

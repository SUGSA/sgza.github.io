                Globe every year. South Africa’s event has been running for over ten years. It enjoys a reputation for
                being an excellent opportunity to learn and to connect with the local Agile and Scrum community; making
                it a popular, highly anticipated event in the calendar. </p>

        <h3>Call for Papers - Welcome Change</h3>
        <p>As Heraclitus, the famous Greek philosopher said, “The only thing constant in life is change.” This is
            something we can all relate to in our current work circumstances, yet there are so many uncertainties, and
            sometimes fear, around change.
        </p>
        <p>
            How do we support the radical impact of change on the people in organisations? What do we need to nurture to
            scale Agile, as many companies are finding that aligning efforts are exceeding capacity? </p>
        <p>
            How can we leverage practices that support Agile values and principles to build new habits that enable a new
            way of working on both team and organisational level? And while we focus on improving the speed at which we
            deliver, how do we know we’re building the right thing? What mindset, tools, or techniques will help us?

        </p>
        <p>This year we’re looking for perspectives and insights that welcome change. We’d like to explore opposing
            positions, discover unexpected views and leave with a slightly more open, inclusive view of the world.


        </p>
        <p>There is so much knowledge and wisdom in our community - we’re looking for speakers and attendees that will
            help us to create a conference which not only creates a safe space to learn but deep dives into what it
            means to welcome change as an Agilist.
        </p>
        <p>We value:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New ideas <strong>over</strong> old content</li>
            <li>Specific opinion <strong>over</strong> one-size-fits-all</li>
            <li>Own experiences from the field <strong>over</strong> theory</li>
            <li>Interactive sessions <strong>over</strong> sit-and-listen (but there’s room for both)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want to be sure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your proposal supports our theme – Welcome Change – and that it contributes depth (or breadth)
                to
                the community’s discussions
            </li>
            <li>You can comfortably deliver what you’re proposing, regardless of whether you are well known or a
                first-timer on the conference speaking scene
            </li>
            <li>People will be excited and intrigued to attend your session</li>
            <li>People will get something of value from the time spent in your session</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don’t need to achieve all the points above, but if you don’t hit at least a few of them, you need to
            give
            it more thought.
        </p>
        <strong>How to get rejected:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Include a same-old, same-old topic or approach (unless there’s a new twist or a truly deep
                experience
                base)
            </li>
            <li>Include thinly-veiled (or unveiled) marketing or promotion of services</li>
            <li>Your submission’s golden thread and “Why?” are difficult to follow or understand</li>
            <li>It does not appear that an adequate level of effort was involved in your submission</li>
            <li>Include specific personally-identifying information (name, company you work for) in the body of the
                submission – please do not do this – we follow a blind review and selection process (we hide names
                of
                people submitting in the system, so that the selection process is free from bias)
            </li>
            <li>Your submission does not address any of the topic tracks outlined below</li>
        </ul>

            clarify the
            CFP in this style)</i>
        <br /><br />

            talk
            and workshop respectively.</p>

        <h3>Our Topic Tracks</h3>
        <p>This year we have decided to not provide tracks, in order to be less restrictive. For every Gathering, we
            receive a broad variety of interesting topics, some not always fitting into the predefined tracks. In the
            spirit of welcoming change, we wanted to increase the diversity of submissions that make it into the program
            and allow you, the speaker, to share whatever you believe the attendees will find valuable.</p>

        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
        <h6><i>(guidance for submitting a session)</i></h6>
        <h5>A workshop versus a talk</h5>
        <p>A good guideline for a workshop is that the time you will be speaking needs to be 40% or less of the total
            session time, with the remainder of the time to be used for participant activities (doing an exercise or
            activity or interacting with other attendees). Workshops are typically 90 mins in length with talks being
            45mins.</p>
        <p>We pride ourselves on hosting a conference where all speakers respect each other, and the audience, allowing
            us to run on schedule.</p>

        <h5>A lightning talk</h5>
        <p>A lightning talk is short and punchy - just 15 minutes - including a quick intro from the room’s facilitator
            and any Q&A.</p>
        <p>A lightning talk doesn’t need to offer a solution, it can be designed to start a conversation, spark ideas
            and get people thinking or it could be sharing something interesting you’ve experienced.</p>

        <!-- <h5>Equipment available</h5>
        <p>Each room is equipped with a projector, a flipchart with markers, sticky notes and pens.</p>
        <p>The rooms are generally laid out with tables and chairs in banquet style.</p>
        <p>If you require any specialised items or room settings, please list these in the ‘notes’ section of Sessionize
            and we will try to accommodate you. We cannot guarantee this, so we will remain in contact with you while
            managing logistics.</p> -->

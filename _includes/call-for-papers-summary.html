                <p>Numerous instances of the Regional Scrum Gathering®, supported by Scrum Alliance, take place around the
                    Globe every year. South Africa’s event has been running for over ten years. It enjoys a reputation for
                    being an excellent opportunity to learn and to connect with the local Agile and Scrum community; making
                    it a popular, highly anticipated event in the calendar. </p>
    
                <p>In light of our theme for next year we are in search of speakers to present talks and workshops focusing

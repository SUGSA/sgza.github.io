            <p>This document details the SUGSA committee’s expectations of speakers at the conference
                (speakers and workshop facilitators will be referred to as ‘speakers’ throughout this document).
                Please get in touch with us on <a href="emailto:info@sugsa.org.za">info@sugsa.org.za</a> should you have
                any
                concerns or questions
                relating to this document.</p>

            <h3>General code of conduct:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SUGSA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
                    everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                    body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). All speakers are expected to adhere to
                    SUGSA’s Code of Conduct:
                    <a href="https://sugsa.org.za/about-us/code-of-conduct/"
                        target="_blank">https://sugsa.org.za/about-us/code-of-conduct/</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Accommodation, Travel and Reimbursements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>SUGSA will arrange and pay for accommodation for the main speaker for each session (workshop,
                        talks, and lightning talks) for 2 nights of the conference. These 2 nights will commence on
                        Thursday and Friday, 16–17 March 2023 and a single room will be selected. This accommodation and
                        travel allowance is not exchangeable for other dates or persons, nor is it exchangeable for
                        cash.</li>
                    <li>For local speakers (within SA), excluding lightning talks - SUGSA will reimburse travel costs
                        (flights, taxis etc.) up to the value of R3000. Receipts will be required for all reimbursement
                        costs.</li>
                    <li>For international speakers (outside SA), excluding lightning talks - SUGSA will reimburse travel
                        costs (flights, taxis etc.) up to the value of R22 000. Receipts will be required for all
                        reimbursement costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>For lightning talk speakers - SUGSA will reimburse travel costs (flights, taxis etc.) up to the
                        value of R1000. Receipts will be required for all reimbursement costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Speakers who do not reside in the same city as the conference are requested to arrive the night
                        before the conference so that they are able to attend both days. Should this not be possible,
                        please make alternative arrangements with a SUGSA committee member.</li>
                    <li>Reimbursement will be issued per accepted session, not per speaker. For co-speakers, this means
                        that travel costs and accommodation will need to be shared.</li>
                    <li>Reimbursement process:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In order for reimbursements to be paid, a travel invoice will need to be submitted to SUGSA
                            for processing. The original invoice from the travel provider is a regulatory requirement
                            necessary for us to release foreign payments.</li>
                        <li>Reimbursements will only be processed after the completion of the conference.
                        </li>
                        <li>Speakers should have submitted reimbursement claims no later than 14 days after the
                            conference.</li>
                        <li>Any claims received after the cut-off date may experience delays in processing.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our speakers are an important part of our community. As such, we hope the speakers will attend
                        and
                        participate, as much as possible, during the 2 day conference.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Speakers’ Dinner is held the night before the conference begins, with speakers, committee
                        members, and sponsors, at SUGSA’s cost. It is requested that speakers make themselves available
                        for this event or agree to alternative arrangements with a committee member.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>During Workshops or Talks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>By agreeing to speak at the Regional Scrum Gathering® South Africa 2022, speakers consent
                        to have a committee member introduce them to the audience and to ensure that the
                        session remains on schedule. This includes the use of visual cues (printed flashcards) to
                        indicate progress against the scheduled end time, and bringing the session to a close if
                        the speaker does not do so timeously. For either format, we recommend allocating the
                        last 15 minutes for questions and answers from the audience. We pride ourselves on
                        hosting a conference where all speakers respect each other and the audience, allowing
                        us to run on schedule.
                    </li>
                    <li>SUGSA will provide the following stationery and supplies:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stickies (Post-it notes)</li>
                            <li> Markers</li>
                            <li>AV facilities</li>
                            <li>Flipcharts, 1 per room</li>
                            <li>Tech connections </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>It is expected that the talk or workshop that the speaker gives remains aligned to the content
                        and
                        structure as submitted in their proposal, and accepted onto the program. We request that as a
                        speaker, you pay careful attention to this as conference attendees make selections for talks
                        they
                        would like to attend based on the information submitted and published.</li>
                    <li>If a speaker would like us to share their slides with our community following the
                        conference, we require the slides within two working days from the last day of the
                        conference.
                    </li>
                    <li>SUGSA will collect feedback after the talk or workshop via the event app. The feedback
                        will be shared with the speaker following the conference.
                    </li>
                    <li>SUGSA may choose to record the images, film and sound of your talk to distribute during or after
                        the
                        event.</li>
                    <li>SUGSA acknowledges and appreciates the contributions made by the speaker(s) and their companies
                        that
                        contribute to the success of our community. Speakers will be allowed to mention their Company
                        and
                        Agile-related products, books, and services as part of their introduction, however, extended
                        sales-pitches disguised as sessions are not welcome.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cancellation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>While we have taken every precaution to ensure that the Gathering will continue as planned, in
                        the
                        event that Regional Scrum Gathering®(SM) South Africa 2023 needs to be cancelled due to any
                        unforeseen circumstances, all speakers will be notified immediately.
                    </li>
